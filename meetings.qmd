# Meetings {#sec-meetings}

We have meetings. We hold them via Zoom. We may hold them in other ways or locations, but that's the norm.

::: callout-important
We will be experimenting with another method of keeping notes from meetings.
:::

## Types and frequency

We have a weekly 30-minute meeting just to check in. This is *required* and is how we make sure everyone's making progress and up-to-speed!

-   Researchers actively working
    -   Briefly update the lab on whatever they are working on and progress made.
    -   This is also an opportunity for practice talks, elevator pitches for new project ideas, so on.
-   Assistants/workers
    -   Check-ins.
-   Faculty Research Fellows and Guests
    -   Same as researchers above, but you are welcome to take the reigns!

If you fall into one of these categories and have not received an invite to the meetings, please contact the director.

## Notes/Minutes

Notes and minutes from meetings[^meetings-1] will--again, when appropriately public-facing--will be kept in the lab's OSF ecosystem.

Template for meeting notes in markdown. This is also found in the [meeting-notes](https://github.com/mavrxlab/meeting-notes) repo, along with instructions on how to add/update/correct meeting notes:
