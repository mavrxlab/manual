Mentoring takes many forms, but frequently involves looking out for those more junior.\nWork towards proficiency in research production and knowledge distribution (not to mention R!).\nBe patient, including with your PI. He will forget things you just talked about, and repeat some stories over and over. Organization and comprehensive note-taking is a great solution to his absent-mindedness.\nAdvocate for our own needs, including personal and career goals.\nRespect each others’ strengths, weaknesses, differences, and beliefs.\nIf you move something, put it back.\nCharge all devices.\nKeep everything awesome.\n\n\n\nSmaller Picture\nMA{VR}X Lab physical spaces are not that big (ironic, considering the infinite spaces and opportunities in extended reality), so please be thoughtful of others you’re with and who will come later:\n\nDo not come to the lab if you are sick. Period. If you are sick, DM your faculty advisor or the director to let me know you won’t be coming in. If appropriate, update your lab calendar to reflect the change.\nBe considerate with the thermostat. Everyone has different preferences, so we all need to learn to compromise. In B158, the air handler is also very loud, which may come into play if we are recording something.\nDo not leave food, drinks, or crumbs out in the lab. Please put food trash in another trash can (not in the lab!), especially late in the day or on Friday (so that food doesn’t stay in the lab over the weekend).\nLock the door if there is no one in the lab, even if you will only be gone for “a minute”.\nAvoid wearing strong perfumes/colognes/et cetera in the lab (for the sake of your coworkers, lab visitors, and our participants).\nKeep the lab neat—especially in the back of B158 in the VR boundary. Items left unattended may be discarded, reclaimed, or recycled.\nWear a mask until further notice."

Students will be provided access to the lab’s resources (computers, space, software, guidance, collaboration, et cetera) in return for helping the lab make progress toward its goal of research and knowledge production.\nThat said, student volunteers are still expected to have a regular and consistent presence in the lab, adhering to the “Main Expectations” at the top of this page. Volunteering in the lab does not mean a student can come and go as they please or ghost on projects because they got busy! Volunteering is still a serious commitment.\n\n\nFor-Credit\nWhile each semester, each student, and each team are unique, undergraduate research fellows engaging in a for-credit independent study or capstone should expect to end the semester in which they are receiving credit with a variety of deliverables: for example, an annotated bibliography of ~10 articles on the topic they’ve been studying, a ~10 minute presentation to the department, a conference paper, and so on. This is the minimum requirement that is for the lab; depending on how you’ve enrolled, you may have additional requirements.\n\n\nLab Assistants\nSome students will be paid to “work in the lab,” which could be anything from assisting in faculty research to lab maintenance to doing market research. While undergraduate research fellows may also be lab assistants, an overlap is not necessarily required or expected. These are generally funded by particular grants and thus will have specific project-related tasks and expectations.\n\n\nHonors\nHonors Contracts and theses are relatively rare, so simply contact the director for more information on this."

You may find that faculty-driven content may reside elsewhere but should still be linked within an OSF project. That repository can then be linked to the OSF sub-project.\nHaving a well-written and organized README file in your repository is absolutely essential. To conform with UA Research Data Repository Policies (and to have a consistent organization), you should at least start with the README_template.txt they provide. You are also encouraged to maintain a step-by-step process that describes your project environment, how to run any cleaning scripts (if applicable), and how to reproduce the manuscript/slide deck/et cetera. The 2014 Software in Research survey readme is a good example of this.\nLikewise, when describing commits in GitHub or describing updates in OSF, please don’t skimp. Commits are cheap and the next person that reads what you left will thank you.1\nNote that you don’t just have to be coding applications to use GitHub! Use it for slide decks, papers, websites, and all sorts of things (like this lab manual, for example!).\n\n\nFilenames\nWe believe in standardizing as much as we can in order for consistency and clarity. Filenames should be chosen using the three considerations delimited by Jenny Bryan’s “How to name files”. They should have the following qualities:\n\nMachine readable\nHuman readable\nPlays well with default ordering\n\nYou’ll want to name your files like YYYY-MM-DD_Project-name_Sub-identifier_Slug.ext or some such."

Some services like 3D scanning of a property using a Matterport camera requires a certain amount of training. Other services, like providing assistance with software, can be done by those with the expertise necessary. Remember to let the director know if you have a particular skill that you’d like to offer as a service through the lab. (Know Unity? Perfect. Proficient with Adobe Aero? Awesome. These are great services to offer.)"

    "text": "Authorship\nTo transparently and fairly maintain a record of contributions, the lab follows the CRediT - Contributor Roles Taxonomy. These roles are as follows:\n\nConceptualization\nData curation\nFormal Analysis\nFunding acquisition\nInvestigation\nMethodology\nProject administration\nResources\nSoftware\nSupervision\nValidation\nVisualization\nWriting – original draft\nWriting – review & editing\n\nIncluding a spreadsheet in your project directory that keeps track of who is fulfilling which role is required. Note that some roles may not be applicable (a student working on a self-directed project likely could ignore the Funding acquisition role, for example).\n\nContribution\nWhat counts as a contribution? Keep in mind that the CRediT taxonomy above is not a checklist insofar as it is not binary; making some punctuation changes in a manuscript, while technically “editing,” does not necessarily qualify you for the Writing - review & editing role. You should consider contributions to be substantive and meaningful.\nTo be considered an author on a publication, you should have:\n\ndesigned one or more experiment or survey instrument,\nwrote the initial draft for a major section,\nwrote the entire paper, and/or\ndesigned and carried out the analyses.\n\nThis is not to say that not having been involved to this degree means your work goes unappreciated or unacknowledged. For example, to receive named recognition in the author note or acknowledgements section, depending on the type of publication, you might have:\n\nhelped to carry out data collection,\ncreated a table or figure,\ncreated or cleaned a data set,\nengaged in media wrangling and editing, and/or\nhelped edit or proofread the manuscript.\n\n\n\nAuthor Order1\nAuthor order is not arbitrary, nor is it necessarily simply a descending list based on effort, at least the first and last author positions, specifically. That is, when involving student researchers, the first author typically goes to the student that wrote the majority of the paper, while the last author is the faculty research advisor, principle investigator, or the lab director (if they provided guidance).\nNote that there is typically also a corresponding author, who is essentially the point-of-contact for the work. They are the shepherd for that particular project and are in charge of correspondence. This is typically the first or last author.\nWithin the MA{VR}X Lab, there are generally four kinds of publication authorship considerations:\n\nIf the director or a faculty research fellow designed the experiment/project and was responsible for most of the authoring, they will be first and corresponding author.\nIf a student researcher assisted in some the research (by carrying out some of the experimentation, for example) under the supervision of the director or a faculty research fellow but the student was not responsible for the research design and/or writing most of the paper, the same applies from #1.\nIf a student researcher was primarily/entirely responsible for designing and conducting research, and wrote most of the paper, all under the supervision of the director or a faculty research fellow, the student researcher will be first author and the director or faculty research fellow will be last and corresponding author.\nAuthorship with graduate students is usually decided on a one-by-one project basis. Discuss this with your supervisor.\n\nGenerally speaking, if lab resources are being utilized, the director should have at least some advisory role in the publications or products and will likely default to last author.\n\n\n\n\nMinda, John P, and Emily Nielsen. 2018. “Lab Manual.” OSF. osf.io/8b6kj."

This creates the basis for the next stages like the IRB and pre-registration (remember, the IRB even requires a basic literature review and your study will absolutely need it, so best to begin early).\n\nThis is very likely exploratory at this stage and that is just fine. You may even flip back and forth between steps 1 and 2 as you delve deeper into the topic. Again, perfectly normal and expected. This is what research is all about."

In the MA{VR}X Lab, we mainly use R and encourage the use of easily reproducable analyses and reports through platforms like Quarto. As such, the following steps are aligned toward this. (If you’ve already done this once, the process for the project is simply creating a new repository from the project template and running with it. This section is for first time users!)\n\nGet your repo up and running.\n\nLog into GitHub using your UArizona NetID.\nBe sure you’ve been added to the lab’s GitHub Organization! (If not, DM the director on Teams.)\nVisit the Project Template repository: https://github.com/mavrxlab/project-template\nClick the green “Use this template” button to “Create a new repository.”\nSet the Owner to the lab. Give your repository a meaningful (but short!) name. Hyphens for spaces.\nWrite a longer description. You can always flesh this out later.\nSelect Private visibility. (This is your working repository. Outputs and products will go elsewhere.)\nClick the green Create repository from template button!\n\nGet your repo into your computer where you can work on it. \n\nI encourage GitKraken as your Git interface as it’s got great project organization options like Workspaces: https://www.gitkraken.com/git-client\nNow’s a great time to get familiar with the interface with the GitKraken-provided cheatsheet and the interface introduction video.\nMake sure you’ve gotten your GitHub Student Developer pack so you can get GitKraken for free! https://www.gitkraken.com/github-student-developer-pack-bundle\nCreate a folder on your computer where you want the repository to live as a subfolder. So, you can create Repos\\ somewhere if you want it to be a subfolder of that.\nBack in GitKraken, Clone from GitHub.com the repository you created into that folder. It will create a subfolder with the name of your repo. For example, if you called your repo my-project, it’ll live in Repos\\my-project\\\nPull the repository (the ⬇️ icon toward the top, or hit Ctrl-P to open the command palette and search for pull). Now you have your repository on your computer!\n\nInstall R, Quarto, and RStudio so you can begin working in that project.\n\nInstall R (the base option): https://cran.r-project.org\nInstall Quarto: https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/\nInstall RStudio (you already installed R, so go straight to #2): https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/\n\nOpen up your project!\n\nNavigate to your local repository (Repos\\my-project\\ in our example).\nYou’ll find a project-template.Rproj file. That’s your project file. Rename it appropriately.\nOpen it up and have a look around!\n\nMake your first commit\n\nNow that you’ve renamed your .Rproj file, if you go back into GitKraken, you’ll see there’s now a change pending.\nFirst, you’ll want to Stage the changes you’ve made: https://help.gitkraken.com/gitkraken-client/staging/\nThen, you’ll Commit those changes: https://help.gitkraken.com/gitkraken-client/commits/\nFinally, you’ll Push your commits: https://help.gitkraken.com/gitkraken-client/pushing-and-pulling/#push\nAnd you’re ready to keep working! (Keep in mind that you’ll probably only have one branch and won’t need the vast majority of Git complexities. That said, learning the platform is a useful skill unto itself, plus you have the option of using GitHub Pages or Netlify to publish content directly from your repositories.)\nNow, if you want to work on another machine, you can just clone the repository there, pull any changes, and voila, you’re good to go!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNever forget to pull before working!\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you’re moving between machines, always be sure to commit and push your changes when you’re done on one machine and pull any updates on the other before starting to work. Failure to do this can result in conflicts!"

They are expected to follow all University policies and processes regarding human research.\nIt is at the College and/or Department’s discretion whether a student or resident can serve as a PI. If a student (whether undergraduate or graduate) or a resident is serving as the PI, then a University advisor must be listed on the Verification of Human Subjects Training Form (VOTF) and have current training. The advisor does not need to be the student’s academic advisor or dissertation/thesis committee member, but must have an academic appointment at the University of Arizona. Advisors must sign off on the human research application and will be copied on all correspondence regarding the student’s human research project.1\n\nOne fringe benefit of needing to go through the IRB process is, having done this, your pre-registration content is almost entirely completed.

    "text": "Pre-registration\nPre-registration is, more or less, a transparent plan of action and justification. See OSF Registries | ADHD and Hyperfocus for a good example of what this looks like. You don’t have to have all the answers, all the exact specifics, but you should endeavor to provide the information you do have and explain why you can’t or won’t provide the others. Why pre-register, though?\n\nThe main goal of preregistering one’s research is to make it easier for readers (and yourself) to distinguish between what the you set out to do (confirmation) and what was discovered along the way (exploration).2\n\nIt also has the benefit of establishing precisely what you intended and expect to find, precluding \\(p\\)-hacking3. That said, remember that pre-registration is a plan and, as such, may become outdated or obsolete when things change unexpectedly. Preferably, if things do change, you should simply create a new pre-registration in the same project and either withdraw the previous one or simply reference the original now out-of-date pre-registration the new one. The time at which you do this is important4.\nHere’s a very important aspect of registering a project:\n\nA registration on OSF creates a frozen, time-stamped version of a project that cannot be edited or deleted. The original project can still be edited, while the registered version cannot. You might create a registration to capture a snapshot of your project at certain points in time – such as right before data collection begins, when you submit a manuscript for peer review, or upon completion of a project.\n\nTechnically, you can update a pre-registration within a particular set of circumstances5. Presume that the research design you’re planning on using is the one you will use. Registration updates are for situations outside the researcher’s control that are necessary to the project’s completion. The logistical changes necessitated by COVID-19 would be one example of this. You should also consider creating a pre-data-collection registration and a pre-data-analysis registration to capture any changes or alterations you’ll be requiring prior to data analysis.\nHow To Properly Preregister A Study - Data Colada\n\nChoose the right pre-registration template: Select a Registration Template – OSF Guides (it is very likely you will choose one of the following)\n\nOSF | Qualitative Preregistration Template.docx\nOSF | Preregistration for Qualitative Research Template.docx (Kern & Skrede Gleditsch, 2017)\nOSF | Pre-Registration in Social Psychology (van ’t Veer & Giner-Sorolla, 2016) Pre-Registration.docx\nOSF | AsPredicted registration.docx6\nOSF | Replication Recipe (Brandt et al., 2013) Pre-Registration.docx\n\n\nIt’s understandable that undergraduate researchers, especially, may feel hesitant to pre-register their work given they’re still learning not just the content they’re researching but how to research. This is actually a great reason to go through the open science framework: that willingness to demonstrate growth, transparency, and a dedication to the process can be tremendously impressive."

That said, should we, they will be expected to:\n\nKnow the literature related to their topic like the back of their hand.\nSeek out and apply for fellowships and awards (including travel awards, et cetera).\nRealize there are times for pulling all-nighters, and times for taking the headset off, leaving early, and spending time with loved ones.\n\n\n\nUndergraduate Research Fellows\nUsually works directly under a faculty member or graduate student. The faculty need not be a member of the lab, but the director or a Faculty Research Fellow should be in the loop at all times. Regardless of how undergraduate students are engaging with the lab, they should:\n\nBe working on a particular project that has been discussed with the director and their faculty advisor.\nAsk around to see if they can help with anything.\nSpend time improving various lab-related skills (learning R or C#, studying Unity, et cetera).\nSpend time writing a blog post, updating or adding sections to the lab manual, and the like.\n\nUndergraduates will generally engage with the lab in one of the following capacities:\n\nVolunteering\nFor-credit (independent study5 or capstone6)\nLab Assistants (paid work)\nHonors7\n\n\n\nVolunteering\nVolunteering in the lab is generally formulated in a resources-for-time transaction. Students will be provided access to the lab’s resources (computers, space, software, guidance, collaboration, et cetera) in return for helping the lab make progress toward its goal of research and knowledge production.\nThat said, student volunteers are still expected to have a regular and consistent presence in the lab, adhering to the “Main Expectations” at the top of this page. Volunteering in the lab does not mean a student can come and go as they please or ghost on projects because they got busy! Volunteering is still a serious commitment.\n\n\nFor-Credit\nWhile each semester, each student, and each team are unique, undergraduate research fellows engaging in a for-credit independent study or capstone should expect to end the semester in which they are receiving credit with a variety of deliverables: for example, an annotated bibliography of ~10 articles on the topic they’ve been studying, a ~10 minute presentation to the department, a conference paper, and so on. This is the minimum requirement that is for the lab; depending on how you’ve enrolled, you may have additional requirements.\n\n\nLab Assistants\nSome students will be paid to “work in the lab,” which could be anything from assisting in faculty research to lab maintenance to doing market research. While undergraduate research fellows may also be lab assistants, an overlap is not necessarily required or expected. These are generally funded by particular grants and thus will have specific project-related tasks and expectations.\n\n\nHonors\nHonors Contracts and theses are relatively rare, so simply contact the director for more information on this."
