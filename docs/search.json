Mentoring takes many forms, but frequently involves looking out for those more junior.\nWork towards proficiency in research production and knowledge distribution (not to mention R!).\nBe patient, including with your PI. He will forget things you just talked about, and repeat some stories over and over. Organization and comprehensive note-taking is a great solution to his absent-mindedness.\nAdvocate for our own needs, including personal and career goals.\nRespect each others’ strengths, weaknesses, differences, and beliefs.\nIf you move something, put it back.\nCharge all devices.\nKeep everything awesome.\n\n\n\nSmaller Picture\nMA{VR}X Lab physical spaces are not that big (ironic, considering the infinite spaces and opportunities in extended reality), so please be thoughtful of others you’re with and who will come later:\n\nDo not come to the lab if you are sick. Period. If you are sick, DM your faculty advisor or the director to let me know you won’t be coming in. If appropriate, update your lab calendar to reflect the change.\nBe considerate with the thermostat. Everyone has different preferences, so we all need to learn to compromise. In B158, the air handler is also very loud, which may come into play if we are recording something.\nDo not leave food, drinks, or crumbs out in the lab. Please put food trash in another trash can (not in the lab!), especially late in the day or on Friday (so that food doesn’t stay in the lab over the weekend).\nLock the door if there is no one in the lab, even if you will only be gone for “a minute”.\nAvoid wearing strong perfumes/colognes/et cetera in the lab (for the sake of your coworkers, lab visitors, and our participants).\nKeep the lab neat—especially in the back of B158 in the VR boundary. Items left unattended may be discarded, reclaimed, or recycled.\nWear a mask until further notice."

Regardless of how undergraduate students are engaging with the lab, they should:\n\nBe working on a particular project that has been discussed with the director and their faculty advisor.\nAsk around to see if they can help with anything.\nSpend time improving various lab-related skills (learning R or C#, studying Unity, et cetera).\nSpend time writing a blog post, updating or adding sections to the lab manual, and the like.\n\nUndergraduates will generally engage with the lab in one of the following capacities:\n\nVolunteering\nFor-credit (independent study5 or capstone6)\nLab Assistants (paid work)\nHonors7\n\n\nVolunteering\nVolunteering in the lab is generally formulated in a resources-for-time transaction. Students will be provided access to the lab’s resources (computers, space, software, guidance, collaboration, et cetera) in return for helping the lab make progress toward its goal of research and knowledge production.\nThat said, student volunteers are still expected to have a regular and consistent presence in the lab, adhering to the expectations of “Everyone” above. Volunteering in the lab does not mean a student can come and go as they please or ghost on projects because they got busy! Volunteering is still a serious commitment.\n\n\nFor-Credit\nWhile each semester, each student, and each team are unique, undergraduate research fellows engaging in a for-credit independent study or capstone should expect to end the semester in which they are receiving credit with a variety of deliverables: for example, an annotated bibliography of ~10 articles on the topic they’ve been studying, a ~10 minute presentation to the department, a conference paper, and so on. This is the minimum requirement that is for the lab; depending on how you’ve enrolled, you may have additional requirements.\n\n\nLab Assistants\nSome students will be paid to “work in the lab,” which could be anything from assisting in faculty research to lab maintenance to doing market research. While undergraduate research fellows may also be lab assistants, an overlap is not necessarily required or expected. These are generally funded by particular grants and thus will have specific project-related tasks and expectations.\n\n\nHonors\nHonors Contracts and theses are relatively rare, so simply contact the director for more information on this."
